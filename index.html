      ê°ÄI've been worki…°n…° on a slow project
      (really an assortment of projects) for a while,
      but I've finally reached a place where
      I can show sli…°ht evidence of my work.
      I somehow …°ot the idea that a keyboard layout could make better sense,
      and then the idea that it could be desi…°ned with visual reference
      to what the IPA and others are doin…° with their phonolo…°ical charts.
      So, I must have done a Íû¨oo…°le search and found keyman.com,
      and have been workin…° on keyboard layouts since.
      I'm typin…° all these words usin…° one of my newly created layouts,
      and I don't yet know whether it's practical yet so much as tedious.
